Our stack
We use Rails as the primary engine
Postgres has the primary DB

for the front, we rely on js, react, css and saas.
The building process for the front is made by webpack, and we rely on the gem webpack-rails to help.
bundle exec rails generate webpack_rails:install

node_modules are references with yarn
