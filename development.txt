TOOLING
some nice tooling can be found on: http://icalialabs.github.io/kaishi/, in particular
- oh-my-zsh
- Homebrew
- launchrocket
- Pow

GIT
look at http://gitref.org for quick reference
to put a specific branch to Heroku, we need to map always to master, git push stagin api:master


Our stack
We use Rails as the primary engine
Postgres has the primary DB

for the front, we rely on js, react, css and saas.
The building process for the front is made by webpack, and we rely on the gem webpack-rails to help.
bundle exec rails generate webpack_rails:install

node_modules are references with yarn

<%= javascript_include_tag *webpack_asset_paths('application', extension: 'js') %>
<%= stylesheet_link_tag *webpack_asset_paths('application', extension: 'css') %>


CUSTOM ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS
Rspec need to be installed globally:  gem install rspec
XCode for MAc to have imageMagic/Rmagic

Imagemagick to process images
BE CAREFULL WE NEED TO HAVE IMAGEMAGICK 6 AND NOT 7
brew install imagemagick@6 && brew link imagemagick@6 --force
check with $convert --version

GRIM is handling PDF
brew install ghostscript poppler

TEST with Phantomjs
brew install phantomjs
