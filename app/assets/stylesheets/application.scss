 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,

 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.
